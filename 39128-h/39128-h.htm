<span class="i0">Two ladies dressed in white appear<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And play two violins.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It's really meant for boys at school,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But girls can also come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when you walk inside the room<br /></span>
<span class="i3">You hear a pleasant hum.<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The older boys wear Eton suits,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The younger boys white tops;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stand together in a row<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And practise curious hops.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The dancing-master shows the step<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With many a puff and grunt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has a red silk handkerchief<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Stuck grandly in his front.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He's awfully excitable,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">His wrists are very strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drags you up and down the room<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Whenever you go wrong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when you're going very wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The girls begin to laugh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when you're pushed back in your place,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The boys turn round and chaff.<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We've learnt the polka and the waltz,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Although he says our final bows<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Give him enormous pain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">Unless you sort of stalk.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when the steps have all been done,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">He takes you by the arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To choose a partner for the dance&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It makes you get quite warm.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You have to bow and look polite,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And ask with a grimace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure of the next quadrille,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And slouch into your place.<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He always picks out girls you hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I really don't know why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when you look across the room<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It almost makes you cry<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To see the girl you would have picked<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dance with another boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a single smile for you,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your heart beats very loud and quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Your breath comes very fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You pinch your partner in the chain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But dances end at last.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You think you will not look at her,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I HEAR the piano, the party's begun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurry up! hurry up! there is going to be fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave your wrap in the hall and tie up your shoes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There isn't a moment, a moment to lose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take a peep at the dining-room as you go by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lemonade, claret cup, orange wine you will spy:<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they're going to have two sorts of ices this year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both strawberry-cream and vanilla, I hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve dances are down on the programme, I see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, do up your gloves, she is waiting for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I hear the piano, the polka's begun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, why does your beastly old sash come undone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's right, are your ready? now don't you forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say how d'ye do and express your regret<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Miss Perkins<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> is laid up in bed with a cold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It isn't my place&mdash;just you do as you're told.<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say, look at Frank,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> he's behaving as though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was playing with cads in a field full of snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's sliding about on the slippery floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All over the room with the kid from next door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's a jolly good thing that Miss Perkins' in bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll probably send old Eliza<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> instead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we hear that she's come, we'll just not attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or tell her we never go home till the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They give all the maids when they come, orange wine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say, do you think I might ask her for nine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All right, only don't say I danced more than twice;<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you do, I'll say you have had more than one ice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother said that you could? She said one of each?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'd better look out or I'll jolly well peach.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You don't care if I do? All right, just you wait!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You'll tell Mrs. Jones we were not to be late?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm not pinching at all, you beastly young sneak!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You <i>won't</i> follow me round when we play hide and seek!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's Dorothy!<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> Pax! You can eat what you like,<br /></span>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
